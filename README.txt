Hello! My name is Maddux, and I'm the creator of this portfolio website. 

I started this website as a fun project that I could use to show off my projects, skills, and personality all in one place. It's definitely helped me grow as an
aspiring Software Engineer and I'm glad I began the project.

I used multiple languages for this website: Typescript, CSS, and a minimal amount of HTML. 
I mainly used the React library and build for my website, and this library allowed me some greater flexibility when it came to styling and building the structure of my website.
